# How to Contribute

Well it hasn't happened yet, but if you feel like you'd like to contribute to this stange little project--Awesome! Here are a few things to keep in mind.

## Code Editing Process and Style
* You should always edit code in Merlin 8 Pro, then export it via CiderPress in order to preserve proper formatting. Merlin 8 Pro does not play nicely with text formatted by modern editors.
* Please make sure to keep the disks in the bin folder on track with the source code extractions.
* Comment as much as possible, but stay within reason. Be sure the comments are informative, and not just wasting precious bytes.
* Currently, every subroutine has a minified version as well as a standalone commented version on the disk, in addition to that subroutine's home library. This means that any time a routine is altered, you should alter it in the library first. Then, when it is changed to your satifaction, delete all but the subroutine and save that as the standalone, being careful not to write over the library itself! Then you can delete all the comments and create the .min file.
  * I plan on writing a program to automate this process in the near future, and it will likely involve storing all minified code on separate disks.

That's it for now! If this project ever gets complicated enough for more than a handful of contributors, we may have to be clear on a few other details. But right now, all contributions are welcome!
