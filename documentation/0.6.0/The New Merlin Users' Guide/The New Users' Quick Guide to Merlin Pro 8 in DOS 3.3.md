## Foreword

This guide is for those of you crazy folk out there who, like myself, choose to use a nearly 40 year-old assembler instead of take advantage of the myriad "better" options available today, in 2020. There are many reasons you might choose to do this: like me, you might be in the middle of something like an archeological media dig, or perhaps reenactment, that allows you to better understand the woes and weariness of assembly programming when it was still a highly relevant language to use. You might be wanting to assemble a program on original hardware, for whatever reason, or you might just be a plain old masochist. This booklet is definitely for the former two, but if you're in it for some pleasurable pain, I'd say go straight to the original manual itself.

But that does bring up a good point: if an original manual exists, and is comprehensive (it is, by all means), then why does one need a new guide today, "quick" or otherwise?
