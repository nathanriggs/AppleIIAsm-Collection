## PART I: STDIO Macros and Subroutine Library

The second disk inthe AppleIIAsm Collection includes all of the macros, subroutines, vectors and reserved memory locations for standard input and output on the Apple II. Note that by "Standard Output," we are primarily referring to the text screen only, and 40-column mode at that. A separate disk, as part of the "inessential" collection, will deal with 80-column mode as well as devices like printers. As for "Standard Input," here we refer to the keyboard and game paddle, though there are plans to also include optional mouse macros and subroutines (in some cases, the mouse is dealt with in the same fashion as the game paddle). Note that as with all libraries, the STDIO library will not function properly without the REQUIRED library.

## STDIO Components

The STDIO library contains the following components:

  - A header file with various hooks, vectors and definitions for the rest of the library as well as use by the end programmer.
  - Macros and subroutines dedicated to standard input and output, which includes keyboard and paddle input routines, 40-column text printing routines, basic text-mode drawing routines, and various macros and subroutines that support other functions provided by the Apple II that don't fit into the previous categories so well.
  - Note that some routines use COUT, while others use direct screen memory manipulation (which is why some macros, especially those for drawing, will not translate to 80-column mode). Whether a macro uses COUT or direct memory access is revealed in the macro's or subroutine's given entry.

Macros are largely grouped here by function rather than by a more arbitrary aphabetical scheme, as used in the REQUIRED library documentation. First, macros and subroutines that do not fit in with any of the other categories will be covered. This seems counterintuitive at first, but hopefully the reasoning for it will reveal itself as the documentation is read (long story short: these miscellaneous subroutines can have drastic effects on the rest of the subroutines). Next, COUT cursor macros and subroutines are detailed, followed by standard input routines and screen output routines that rely on COUT for funtionality.

Lastly, macros and subroutines that directly access screen memory to output characters are covered. Usually, these subroutines and macros are dedicated to creating shapes, lines, and ASCII art in general. Note that while this can be used in tandem with the macros and subroutines that use COUT, the standard COUT routine will not recognize that these characters have been plotted, and the cursor position will remain the same as before.

## STDIO Header File

_Summary_

The STDIO header file is required for all macros and subroutines to work correctly, although there may be a select few that can get away without its inclusion. Primarily, this header file contains vectors and hooks that point to routines found in the Monitor.

*DETAILS*

As with all files in the collection, this header file includes a short heading that provides contact information, date last changed, number of bytes, a short description, etc.

Most of the pointers in the STDIO header are rather self-explanatory, and therefore will not be covered here. When used, some of these may be explained more in the macro or subroutine documentation.
