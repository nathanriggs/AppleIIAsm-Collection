APPLE2 ASSEMBLY
LIBRARY BUILDER
===============

THIS PROGRAM AUTOMATES THE PROCESS OF COPYING VARIOUS MACROS AND SUBROUTINES FROM DIFFERENT DISKS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF CUSTOM PROJECTS USING THIS LIBRARY. PRIMARILY, THIS IS FOR USE IN AN "AUTHENTIC" ENVIRONMENT--THAT IS, NOT EMULATED.
I WOULD FULLY SUGGEST USING SOMETHING LIKE CIDERPRESS IF YOU ARE USING MODERN EQUIPMENT.

NOTE THAT THIS PROGRAM ALSO USES THE LIBRARY IN QUESTION IN ORTER TO DEMONSTRATE HOW THE LIBRARY WORKS. YOU MAY FIND ITS SOURCE CODE ON THE BUILDER'S MAIN DISK.
