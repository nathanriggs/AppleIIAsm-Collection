# Updates

__27-sep-2019__

- As of version 0.5.0, updates will occur on a disk-by-disk basis (as well as appropriate changes to the documentation). 
- version 0.5.0 pretty much breaks any prior work that used the library. While future updates won't be so extreme, now that a stable system is in place, this is to be expected in any update prior to an official version 1.0.
- The main documentation has been moved to a .docx and pdf file, rather than here, due to the length of the document. In the future, this file will be changed to a more open format, as well as converted into a hard-copy friendly design.
